## What This Repo Is

This repository is my individual practice repo for the **“Condensed Lesson: Agile & Git for Your Final Project”** (CSCE 1015 GitHub Assignment 2).

It is NOT the full final team project. Instead, it shows that I understand:

- Agile concepts (sprints, user stories, tasks)
- Git workflows (branches, commits, pull requests)
- GitHub tools (issues and project boards)

My actual team project repo is:  
`https://github.com/utrejo18/1015-No-Brainers`

## Fake Project Used For This Assignment

To practice Agile, I pretend I am building a small app called **“StudyBuddy Task Manager”** that helps students track homework and study tasks.

I use this fake app only as a context for user stories and tasks.

## Repo Structure

- `src/` – Where app code *would* go (placeholder for now)
- `docs/` – Agile planning docs (user stories, sprint plan)
- `assets/` – Any screenshots or images (none yet)

## Agile Artifacts in This Repo

- **User stories** for the StudyBuddy app
- **Sprint plan** for a first mini-sprint
- GitHub **Issues** created from those tasks
- A GitHub **Project Board** to track To Do / In Progress / Done
- Feature branches and Pull Requests that update the docs

## How This Connects to the Assignment Text

From the big “Condensed Lesson: Agile & Git for Your Final Project” document, this repo demonstrates:

- Week 1: Git basics and GitHub repo setup
- Week 2: User stories, issues, and a sprint board
- Proper Git workflow:
  - `main` branch = stable
  - `feature/...` branches = work in progress
  - Pull requests used to merge changes into `main`
